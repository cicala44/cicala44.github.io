I still have my first plan that he wrote out on a piece of looseleaf paper. I can, clearly remember that first race and Chris’s calm, coaching voice during each discipline of the race. With him, I crossed the finish line of my first race as well as my first 70.3 ½ Ironman and countless other races.\n\nHe has consistently pushed me to new limits while ensuring I stay injury-free and motivated. His training plans are well- structured taking into account my strengths weaknesses and crazy life schedules. His communication and feedback keep me on track, making me a more confident athlete.\n\nChris is patient, passionate, encouraging and knowledgeable with, guiding and coaching others to see their potential in Endurance sports. I highly recommend anyone from a beginner to a seasoned athlete who wants to elevate their endurance game to reach out to him. He truly loves what he does and gives 110% to getting you to the finish line."

We would sometimes train together and race together, with me usually grabbing any friendly advice, knowledge or help that he was more than willing to give.\n\nWhen he officially got his coaching license I immediately asked him to coach me for an upcoming Olympic triathlon. I was six weeks out and need help , He put together a tough but comprehensive plan that was easy to follow but showed results. I was able to PR the 10k run at the end instead of the usual, getting passed by multiple competitors in the last mile. We are now two weeks into a 22 week program that through a lot of talking and looking at my past racing and training is tailored to me and the goals that Chris and I spoke at length about.\n\nI would highly recommend Chris as a coach his knowledge not only comes from a book it come firsthand experience from his years of training and racing."

From the very first session, it was clear that Chris not only had a deep understanding of the physical and mental demands of triathlon training but also genuinely cared about my progress and success.\n\nChris created a personalized training plan tailored to my goals and schedule, ensuring I could balance the demands of swimming, cycling, and running without burning out. His expertise in technique and strategy helped me improve my efficiency and confidence in all three disciplines.\n\nWhat really stood out was his ability to motivate and encourage me, even during the toughest parts of training. Whether it was pushing me to get through a grueling brick workout or providing tips to perfect my transitions, Chris was always there with the right advice and unwavering support.\n\nThanks to Chris, I achieved personal bests I never thought possible and crossed the finish line feeling strong and accomplished. I highly recommend Chris to anyone looking to take their triathlon training to the next level. He’s an absolute game-changer!"
