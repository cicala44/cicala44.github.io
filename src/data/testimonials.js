        testimonial: "\tPrior to being trained by Chris I had done two small triathlons and I wanted to continue down that path. Chris and I connected through social media and I was interested in working with him right away. I was very impressed that he has accomplished full Ironmans and many half Ironman races. Chris is extremely knowledgeable about triathlon training no matter what the distance is. He is always positive and friendly and he's there for all of his athletes. He truly wants to see us achieve our goals. Swimming started out as my biggest challenge but with Chris's guidance and workout plans, it has become a strength of mine. I have improved so much in every sport even placing top three in my age group for every triathlon I did this past year. it's a great feeling to do things you never thought were possible. Both training peaks and trainer road are very easy apps to use and Chris takes work and life events into consideration when planning your workouts for the week. He's very accommodating and understanding. I have been trained by chris for over a year and I have no intention of stopping anytime soon. I have bigger plans and goals and I know he's going to get me across that finish line!!",

        testimonial: "\tI began working with Chris a few months after my wife Jeanine did. I am a competitive shooter and firearms instructor, and I teach and compete all around the country. I had gotten into endurance style training the year prior after not running for quite a while. After I had seen first-hand Chris’ personality and attention to detail in scheduling, along with his vast knowledge and experience in the multi-sport world, I decided to sign on with him. I needed a coach that could help improve fitness while helping to manage a busy schedule, as I also train for my sport and teach classes in many states. Our goal was to build fitness while managing the training load properly to keep from burning out and around a schedule that was quite hectic. Originally, we began with just biking and running for the first few months, as those were the most important to my competitive shooting performance. We had quick success after about 6 weeks with increased explosiveness in my running, and noticeable improvements in mental and physical endurance for long days on the range competing and/or teaching. \n\n\tWe added in swimming around the 5th month and have been preparing for next year’s triathlon and competition season coming up. Being a coach myself, one of the things I personally find highly valuable is the relationship aspect between instructor and student. Aside from his exceptional attention to details, the attitude he displays is one that really will resonate with athletes he works with. He is encouraging and inspirational and will make you feel like you CAN do what you’re trying to do! He will also be honest with you when there are opportunities to improve, in a way that doesn’t put you down. These are very important, because you need a coach that will tell you what needs to happen to get you where you want to go honestly, and encourage you to get there! Those two are a VERY powerful combination in getting athletes to meet and exceed their potential! Combine that with a lot of real-world experience, and frequent touch points, and you get INEVITABLE success toward your goals. Lastly, you can tell that what Chris does for his athletes isn’t for money. He does it because he genuinely wants to see people succeed, and will be there for you when you have questions to share his knowledge and vast expertise. He has life-long clients in my wife and I, and we both highly recommend him!",

        testimonial: "Chris Cicala has been an incredible coach in my triathlon journey since 2016 when he “encouraged” me to do a sprint triathlon (as he has encouraged quite a few others as well). I still have my first plan that he wrote out on a piece of looseleaf paper. I can, clearly remember that first race and Chris’s calm, coaching voice during each discipline of the race. With him, I crossed the finish line of my first race as well as my first 70.3 ½ Ironman and countless other races.\n\nHe has consistently pushed me to new limits while ensuring I stay injury-free and motivated. His training plans are well- structured taking into account my strengths weaknesses and crazy life schedules. His communication and feedback keep me on track, making me a more confident athlete.\n\nChris is patient, passionate, encouraging and knowledgeable with, guiding and coaching others to see their potential in Endurance sports. I highly recommend anyone from a beginner to a seasoned athlete who wants to elevate their endurance game to reach out to him. He truly loves what he does and gives 110% to getting you to the finish line.",

        testimonial: "I have know Chris Cicala for about 8 years. We started out as coworkers and when we found out that we were both into similar sport became friends. We would sometimes train together and race together, with me usually grabbing any friendly advice, knowledge or help that he was more than willing to give.\n\nWhen he officially got his coaching license I immediately asked him to coach me for an upcoming Olympic triathlon. I was six weeks out and need help , He put together a tough but comprehensive plan that was easy to follow but showed results. I was able to PR the 10k run at the end instead of the usual, getting passed by multiple competitors in the last mile. We are now two weeks into a 22 week program that through a lot of talking and looking at my past racing and training is tailored to me and the goals that Chris and I spoke at length about.\n\nI would highly recommend Chris as a coach his knowledge not only comes from a book it come firsthand experience from his years of training and racing.",

        testimonial: "I can't thank Chris enough for the incredible support and guidance he provided during training for my first triathlon. From the very first session, it was clear that Chris not only had a deep understanding of the physical and mental demands of triathlon training but also genuinely cared about my progress and success.\n\nChris created a personalized training plan tailored to my goals and schedule, ensuring I could balance the demands of swimming, cycling, and running without burning out. His expertise in technique and strategy helped me improve my efficiency and confidence in all three disciplines.\n\nWhat really stood out was his ability to motivate and encourage me, even during the toughest parts of training. Whether it was pushing me to get through a grueling brick workout or providing tips to perfect my transitions, Chris was always there with the right advice and unwavering support.\n\nThanks to Chris, I achieved personal bests I never thought possible and crossed the finish line feeling strong and accomplished. I highly recommend Chris to anyone looking to take their triathlon training to the next level. He’s an absolute game-changer!",

        testimonial: "\tI have been very fortunate to have been coached by Chris over the last year. When I got into Triathlons, I immediately knew that I was going to enjoy doing them. After finishing a couple of sprint and Olympic triathlons in 2024, I thought I would start to take this seriously in 2025 and decided to hire a coach. Chris was exactly what I needed. The results showed in 2025. I knocked off 45 minutes off of one of my Olympic triathlons that I decided to do again in 2025 after doing it in 2024. In addition, he got me to complete my first half ironman and I am eagerly looking to complete more under his guidance.\n\n\tOne of the things that appeals to me about Chris’s coaching is that he always thinking about variables that most people wouldn’t think about. It’s more than just doing the workout that is on the schedule that day or for the week. He’s made me realize the time needed to get workouts in, the costs associated with certain things, the mental approach to doing each component of triathlon and so many other variables. Chris really takes the time to understand you as a person and that definitely factors into how he builds my workout plans. He’s also extremely patient when I throw curve balls into my training schedule and finds a way to make it all work without compromising the quality of the overall workout plan.\n\n\tFinally, I cannot overlook how beneficial it has been to be around other athletes that are part of Endurance Legion Team. The support and comradery of the team is another benefit to working with Chris!\n\n\tI cannot wait to train another year with Chris and the Endurance Legion team and look forward to seeing my results continue to improve!",
